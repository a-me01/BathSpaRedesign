            This new wildlife conservation degree will give you the opportunity to learn about the lives of wild animals and plants, and explore how you can help to overcome the challenges that they face. 
        </p>

        <p class="p2">
            You'll look at the rapidly developing field of conservation biology, including threats to biodiversity and opportunities for habitat management and creation. You'll learn about the biology and behaviour of animals, the importance of a variety of biomes, and the different flora and fauna that they support. You'll consider how we can use this understanding to aid their protection using interdisciplinary approaches. 
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
            The course is rooted in biology and will also cover the social and economic issues related to wildlife conservation and the place of wildlife within our lives. You'll be encouraged to explore and develop brave and creative approaches to protecting the natural world including elements from the arts. Fieldwork will form an important part of your study, and you'll build experience and develop practical skills by interacting directly with nature.

            <h3 class="quote"> “The Newton Park campus is a fantastic resource for studying conservation. I've learned industry-standard sampling techniques on site, practising on vegetation and watercourses, and I've designed and run a research project here. I've also assisted with great crested newt surveys on campus. The department has decades of wildlife records for Newton Park, providing rich context for many studies.”</h3>
